# spi-lib-spider

[SPIder](https://github.com/niklasekstrom/spider/) is an adapter that connects to the
clockport on an Amiga, and provides two SPI controllers.

This is a modification of Niklas Ekstroms SPI and clock port configuration module to work with the forked firmware at [SPIder](https://github.com/AidanHolmes/spider).

This module is a standalone lib build for all drivers using the SPIder hardware. Build files are for SAS/C on the Amiga.

## Build

Type smake in root directory to build Release and Debug target libs.
